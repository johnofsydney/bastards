<h3>Where the bloody hell are the females?</h3>
<p>
  Male candidates dominate nominations for safe seats for the major parties in the House of Representatives â€“ 84% of Coalition candidates and 67% of Labor candidates in safe seats are male.

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Coalition has 34% female candidates but only 16% in safe seats (>6% margin)</strong></li>

  <li><strong>
Overall Labor is closer to gender equity but has nominated only 35% females in safe seats</strong></li>
<li><strong>
Where there is heavy lifting to be done (in swing seats with <6% margin), both parties have nominated a higher proportion of females (Labor 58%, Coalition 49%)
